# Objective: Unleash the Power of Hybrid Cloud

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Navigate CloudOut archival functionality
* Explore CloudOn and Cloud Conversion options
* Understand Cloud-Native Protection

This section will provide you the opportunity to explore some of the Rubrik functionality for public cloud. This section provides more of an overview rather than a guided lab experience. 

## **Getting Started**

The word nephology means the study or contemplation of clouds. Rubrik enables enterprises to utilize public cloud \(i.e. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform\) or private cloud for all aspects of data management â€“ backup, replication and DR, archival, test/dev, and more. Backups can be used to convert VMs into cloud instances for on-demand application migration and cloud test/dev. 

Rubrik Polaris Cloud-Native Protection can be used to protect and manage applications such as Microsoft Office 365, AWS EC2 instances, and cloud databases.
