# Microsoft 365

Polaris provides data management and protection services for Microsoft 365 data sources.&#x20;

Polaris uses Azure cloud computing services for all Microsoft 365 data operations, including backup and restore. All data management computing activities run within the Azure account hosted either by Rubrik or the customer. The protected data does not leave the hosting Azure tenant, which ensures data security and privacy.

Polaris backs up the data of:

* Exchange Mailboxes
* OneDrives
* SharePoint document librariesa
* Team channels

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Setting up a Rubrik Hosted subscription
* Create a Polaris SLA Domain
