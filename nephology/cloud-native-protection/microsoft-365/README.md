# Microsoft 365

Polaris provides data management and protection services for Microsoft 365 data sources.&#x20;

Polaris uses Azure cloud computing services for all Microsoft 365 data operations, including backup and restore. All data management computing activities run within the Azure account hosted either by Rubrik or the customer. The protected data does not leave the hosting Azure tenant, which ensures data security and privacy.

Polaris backs up the data of:

* Exchange Mailboxes
* OneDrives
* SharePoint document librariesa
* Team channels

Polaris creates a first full snapshot of the Microsoft 365 data. This first full snapshot is a complete backup. Then, Polaris creates incremental snapshots based on the changed information, such as deleted email messages or files.
