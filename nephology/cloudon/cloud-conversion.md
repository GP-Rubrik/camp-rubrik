Once connectivity has been established to AWS and/or Azure, the **Overview** pane will display the **Cloud Conversion** field in which you may click **Configure**.

A **Configure Cloud Conversion** dialog will appear, in which you may toggle the choice between:

* Auto Convert Latest Snapshot - Keep One
* Auto Convert Latest Snapshot - Keep All

This configuration results in the latest snapshot being converted into a cloud image, for example, an AMI or VHD. This image can be used to spin up as many instances of the workload as desired.
