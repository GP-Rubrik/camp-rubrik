6. This will live mount the VMDK to the Windows 10 VM. You can check this by opening up the HTML5 vSphere client from the Chrome bookmark bar.
7. After logging into the vSphere client, click on `Win10-vm1` and look at the **Related Objects** to see the NFS datastore mounted from the Rubrik cluster.

13. Navigate to the `E:\logos` folder on the disk and verify the Rubrik logos exist.
14. Return to the Rubrik UI and navigate to **Live Mounts **>** vSphere VMs**, select the ellipsis (`...`) menu choose **Unmount**. Confirm the unmount.
